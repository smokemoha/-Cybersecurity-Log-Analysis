## Overview

This repository contains a detailed cybersecurity analysis of `web_requests.log`, focusing on identifying suspicious activities and potential security vulnerabilities. The investigation uncovered a critical insight into automated process behavior and session management within the network.

## Key Findings

Through meticulous log analysis, the primary finding is related to an automated process (associated with `authorizedUserId: "mdB7yD2dp1BFZPontHBQ1Z"`) originating from IP address `192.168.0.101`. This process experienced prolonged authentication failures (64 consecutive `401 (UNAUTHORIZED)` responses) over a 16-hour period due to an expired session token. This highlights a potential vulnerability in session management for automated tasks, leading to unnecessary resource consumption and potential alert fatigue.

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Recommendation:** Implement robust session management for automated processes, including token refresh mechanisms or dedicated service accounts with non-expiring credentials.

## Analysis Methodology

The analysis was conducted using a systematic approach, leveraging powerful command-line tools available in Kali Linux:

1.  **Log File Examination**: Initial review of `web_requests.log` structure and volume.
2.  **Unauthorized Access Detection**: Identification and quantification of `401 (UNAUTHORIZED)` errors.
3.  **Source IP Identification**: Tracing suspicious user IDs to their originating IP addresses.
4.  **Behavioral Analysis**: In-depth examination of the suspicious IP's activity timeline.
5.  **Comparative Analysis**: Contrasting suspicious behavior with normal user patterns across different IPs.
6.  **Reporting**: Documenting findings, impact, and recommendations in a professional report.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Operating System**: Kali Linux
- **Log Analysis**: `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `head`
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Documentation**: Markdown
- **Screenshot Utility**: `gnome-screenshot` (or `scrot`)

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/smokemoha/-Cybersecurity-Log-Analysis
